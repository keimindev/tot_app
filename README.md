# T.o.T (Trace of Time)

### A time tracking journal started to create a routine. 

T.O.T is a time-tracking application. It serves as a time record book where users can track how much they read and study each day, allowing them to monitor their activities for the month.

I've been striving to create a routine by dedicating 30 minutes of reading every day. However, I found it difficult to track my monthly or weekly reading time using the existing book apps, and there was also inconvenience as I mainly read original books. Therefore, I decided to create my own journal.

### Hidden story

Initially, I quickly built it as a web platform, but later decided to recreate it as an app for more convenient use while on the move. I also wanted to redesign it to make it more accessible to users. While rebuilding it as an app, I added various new designs and features.
